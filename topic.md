I am teaching a class on learning the go programming language. The participants are experienced developers with no prior knowledge of the Go programming language. I would like to provide best practices when necessary. Provide additional resources.

Create a lesson on the following topic:

About GO
- Features of go	
- Where is go a good language to use?	
- Where is go not a good language to use?
