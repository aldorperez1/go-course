I am teaching a class on learning the go programming language. The participants are experienced developers with no prior knowledge of the Go programming language. I would like to provide best practices when necessary. Provide additional resources.

Create a lesson on the following topic:

- Interfaces	
	- Shows an example program about how a type can have many interfaces to allow it to be considered many different types.	
	- Implementation	
	- Method sets	
	* Polymorphism	
	* Explain Type Embedding	
	- Struct embedding	
	- Interface embedding	
	* original list	
	- Type assertions

	- Type switches
