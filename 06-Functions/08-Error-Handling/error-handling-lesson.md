Lesson: Error Handling in Go

Objective: 
To understand the concepts and best practices of error handling in the Go programming language, including the use of defer, panic, recover, and error handling techniques in the standard library.

1. Introduction to Error Handling:
   - Error handling is an essential aspect of robust software development.
   - In Go, error handling is explicit and encourages the use of return values to indicate errors.
   - Go provides built-in mechanisms for error handling to ensure reliable and predictable behavior.

2. Errors in Go:
   - In Go, errors are represented by the `error` interface type.
   - The `error` interface has a single method: `Error() string`, which returns the error message.
   - The `error` type is commonly used to represent both recoverable and unrecoverable errors.

3. Creating Custom Errors:
   - Go provides two main functions for creating custom errors in the standard library:
     - `errors.New`: Creates a basic error with a given error message. Usage: `errors.New("error message")`.
     - `fmt.Errorf`: Creates a formatted error message using the fmt package's syntax. Usage: `fmt.Errorf("error: %s", err)`.

4. Handling Errors:
   - Go emphasizes returning errors explicitly from functions.
   - Functions that may return errors usually have a return type of `(result, error)`.
   - By convention, the last return value is the error, and it's commonly named `err`.
   - After calling a function that may return an error, it's essential to check the error value before proceeding.

5. Defer:
   - `defer` is a Go statement that schedules a function call to be executed when the surrounding function returns.
   - It is often used to ensure that resources are properly released, even if an error occurs.
   - Defer statements are executed in a last-in-first-out (LIFO) order.
   - Defer statements can be helpful for closing files, releasing locks, and other cleanup tasks.

6. Panic and Recover:
   - In exceptional situations where a program cannot continue execution, it can use `panic` to terminate the program.
   - `panic` is commonly used for unrecoverable errors, such as out-of-bounds array access or nil pointer dereference.
   - When a panic occurs, it triggers a stack unwinding process, and deferred functions are executed.
   - The `recover` function can be used to regain control of a panicking goroutine and handle the error gracefully.
   - `recover` can only be called inside a deferred function.
   - Recovering from a panic allows the program to continue executing rather than terminating.

7. Best Practices for Error Handling:
   - Prefer returning errors explicitly rather than using panic.
   - Use `defer` to release resources and perform cleanup tasks.
   - Handle errors as close to the source as possible to provide context and meaningful error messages.
   - Avoid ignoring errors or using a blanket `panic` or `recover` statement.
   - Log or report errors appropriately to aid in debugging and troubleshooting.

8. Exercise:
   - Provide a code snippet where an error occurs, and demonstrate how to handle it using the concepts discussed in the lesson.
   - Discuss and explain the choices made in error handling for the given code snippet.

9. Conclusion:
   - Error handling is a critical aspect of writing reliable and maintainable Go programs.
   - Go's explicit error handling approach, along with the use of defer, panic, and recover, ensures robust error handling.
   - By following best practices and using the standard library's error handling functions, developers can create more reliable and resilient software.
