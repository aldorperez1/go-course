Lesson: Passing Slices between Functions in Go

Introduction:
In Go, slices are powerful and flexible data structures used to represent dynamic collections of elements. When working with slices, it is common to pass them as arguments to functions for processing or modification. In this lesson, we will explore the best practices for passing slices between functions and understand the underlying mechanics.

1. Passing Slices by Value:
   - When a slice is passed as a function argument, a copy of the slice header is created, but it still refers to the same underlying array.
   - Modifications to the elements of the slice inside the function will be reflected in the original slice.
   - Changes to the slice's length or capacity inside the function will not affect the original slice.
   - Provide an example to illustrate this behavior.

2. Passing Slices by Reference:
   - To pass a slice by reference, the function parameter should be a reference (pointer) to the slice.
   - Changes to the slice's length or capacity inside the function will affect the original slice.
   - Assigning a new slice to the parameter inside the function will not affect the original slice.
   - Provide an example to demonstrate this behavior.

3. Best Practices:
   - Prefer passing slices by value when you want to modify the elements of the slice or when you need to share data with the called function.
   - Use passing slices by reference when you want to modify the length or capacity of the slice within the called function.

Conclusion:
Understanding how to pass slices between functions is crucial for effectively working with Go's dynamic collections. By following the best practices and knowing the behavior of passing slices by value or reference, you can optimize your code and leverage the power of Go's slice operations.
