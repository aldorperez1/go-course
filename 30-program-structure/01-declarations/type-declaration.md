Sure! Here are a couple of bullet points on type declaration and why you would use it in Go programming:

- Type Declaration in Go:
  - Type declaration in Go allows you to create custom, named types that are aliases or new representations of existing types.
  - It provides a way to define a new type name with the same underlying type, creating a distinct type identity.

- Reasons for Using Type Declaration:
  - Code Clarity and Readability: Type declarations can improve code readability by giving meaningful names to types and making the code more self-explanatory.
  - Type Safety and Enforcement: Type declarations enable you to create more explicit and type-safe interfaces, reducing the chances of errors and improving code reliability.
  - Abstraction and Encapsulation: Type declarations allow you to abstract away implementation details and encapsulate functionality within custom types, promoting code modularity and maintainability.
  - API Design and Documentation: Type declarations help in designing clean and well-documented APIs by providing clear and descriptive type names that convey the purpose and usage of the underlying data.

Certainly! Here are three slides with an example illustrating the usage of type declaration in Go programming:

Example: Type Declaration for Temperature

Code:
```go
type Celsius float64
type Fahrenheit float64

func main() {
    var temperature Celsius = 25.5
    fmt.Println("Temperature:", temperature, "°C")
}
```



- In the example, we declare two custom types, `Celsius` and `Fahrenheit`, as aliases of the `float64` type.
- The `Celsius` and `Fahrenheit` types provide distinct type identities, allowing us to differentiate between temperature values in different scales.
- We then declare a variable `temperature` of type `Celsius` and assign it a value of `25.5`.
- The program prints the temperature with the corresponding unit symbol, `"°C"`.
