## Title Slide
Maps Internals

---
## Introduction
- Recap: What are maps?
- Maps store key-value pairs.
- Unordered collection of elements.
- Common use cases in Go programming.

---
## Map Implementation Details
a. Hash Function
- Converts keys into hash codes.
- Importance of a good hash function.

---
## Map Implementation Details
b. Buckets and Buckets Array
- Buckets store key-value pairs.
- Buckets array organizes elements.

---
## Map Implementation Details
c. Collision Handling
- Collisions occur when hash codes clash.
- Separate chaining and open addressing.

---
## Map Implementation Details
d. Growth and Rehashing
- Dynamically expands capacity.
- Factors triggering growth.

---
## Best Practices
a. Map Initialization
- Proper map initialization.
- Avoid nil pointer dereferences.

---
## Best Practices
b. Key Types
- Requirements for map keys.
- Keys must be comparable.
- Immutable and hashable key types.

---
## Best Practices
c. Map Access and Manipulation
- Retrieving, updating, and deleting elements.
- Checking key existence.

---
## Best Practices
d. Map Iteration
- Iterating over key-value pairs.
- Unordered nature of maps.
