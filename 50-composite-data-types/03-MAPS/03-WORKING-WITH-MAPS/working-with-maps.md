Lesson: Working with Maps in Go

Objective: In this lesson, participants will learn how to work with maps in the Go programming language. They will understand how to assign values to a map, handle runtime errors related to nil maps, retrieve values from a map, test for the existence of a value, iterate over a map using a for range loop, and remove items from a map.

1. Introduction to Maps:
   - Explain the concept of maps in Go.
   - Emphasize that maps are unordered collections of key-value pairs.
   - Highlight that maps provide efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion operations.

2. Assigning Values to a Map:
   - Demonstrate how to declare a map variable and assign values to it.
   - Show examples of different data types as keys and values in a map.
   - Discuss the importance of unique keys and immutable keys.

3. Runtime Error with Nil Maps:
   - Explain what a nil map is and its implications.
   - Discuss how attempting to assign or retrieve values from a nil map results in a runtime error.
   - Show an example of a runtime error caused by accessing a nil map.

4. Retrieving Values from a Map and Testing Existence:
   - Demonstrate how to retrieve a value from a map using the key.
   - Explain how to test if a key exists in a map using the comma-ok idiom.
   - Show an example of handling the absence of a key in a map.

5. Retrieving Values from a Map and Testing the Value for Existence:
   - Discuss scenarios where the zero value of a value type can be misleading.
   - Explain how to differentiate between a zero value and a non-existent value in a map.
   - Show examples of using pointers or the comma-ok idiom to test for value existence.

6. Iterating over a Map using for Range:
   - Demonstrate how to use a for range loop to iterate over a map.
   - Show examples of accessing both keys and values during iteration.
   - Discuss the random order of iteration due to the unordered nature of maps.

7. Removing an Item from a Map:
   - Explain how to remove an item from a map using the `delete` function.
   - Show examples of deleting a key-value pair from a map.
   - Discuss the behavior of deleting a non-existent key.

Additional Best Practices:
- Avoid modifying a map while iterating over it to prevent unexpected behavior. Instead, create a new map or use a temporary variable for modifications.
- Use descriptive key and value types to enhance code readability and maintainability.
- Initialize maps using the make function (`make(map[keyType]valueType)`).
- Document the expected keys and values in your map using comments for better code documentation.

Assignments:
1. Write a Go program that declares a map to store the population of different cities. Assign values to the map and retrieve the

 population of a specific city.
2. Create a Go program that iterates over a map of book titles and their authors. Print each book's title and author using a for range loop.
3. Extend the previous program to allow the user to remove a book from the map by entering the title.

Note: Encourage participants to explore the provided resources and experiment with maps in their own projects to solidify their understanding.
