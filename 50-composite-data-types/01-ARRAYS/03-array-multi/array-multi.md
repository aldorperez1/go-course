Lesson: Exploring Multidimensional Arrays and Passing Arrays Between Functions in Go

Introduction:
Multidimensional arrays are arrays with more than one dimension, allowing us to represent tabular or grid-like structures. In this lesson, we will dive into multidimensional arrays in Go. We will cover how to declare and access elements in a two-dimensional array, as well as how to assign multidimensional arrays of the same type. Additionally, we will explore the concepts of passing arrays between functions, both by value and by pointer.

1. Declaring Two-Dimensional Arrays:
- A two-dimensional array in Go is an array of arrays, forming a matrix-like structure.
- Syntax: `var arrayName [rows][columns]Type`
- Example: `var matrix [3][3]int` declares a two-dimensional array named "matrix" with 3 rows and 3 columns, containing elements of type int.

2. Accessing Elements of a Two-Dimensional Array:
- Elements in a two-dimensional array are accessed using two sets of square brackets.
- Syntax: `arrayName[rowIndex][columnIndex]`
- Example: `matrix[0][2]` accesses the element at row 0 and column 2 in the "matrix" array.

3. Assigning Multidimensional Arrays of the Same Type:
- Multidimensional arrays can be assigned to each other if they have the same dimensions and element types.
- Example: 
  ```
  source := [3][2]int{{1, 2}, {3, 4}, {5, 6}}
  destination := source // Copies the entire multidimensional array
  ```

4. Assigning Multidimensional Arrays by Index:
- It is also possible to assign specific elements of a multidimensional array.
- Example:
  ```
  array := [2][2]int{{1, 2}, {3, 4}}
  array[1][0] = 10 // Assigns the value 10 to the element at row 1 and column 0
  ```

5. Passing Arrays Between Functions:
- Passing a Large Array by Value Between Functions:
  - By default, arrays in Go are passed by value, which means a copy of the array is made when passing it to a function.
  - Example:
    ```
    func modifyArray(arr [3]int) {
        arr[0] = 10
        // Changes made to arr do not affect the original array
    }
    
    array := [3]int{1, 2, 3}
    modifyArray(array) // Passes a copy of the array
    ```

- Passing a Large Array by Pointer Between Functions:
  - To avoid making a copy of a large array, we can pass it by pointer.
  - Example:
    ```
    func modifyArray(arr *[3]int) {
        (*arr)[0] = 10
        // Changes made to arr affect the original array
    }
    
    array := [3]int{1, 2, 3}
    modifyArray(&array) // Passes a pointer to the array
    ```

Conclusion:
In this lesson, we explored multidimensional arrays in Go, including declaring and accessing elements in a two-dimensional array. We also learned how to assign multidimensional arrays of the same type and assign specific elements using index notation. Additionally, we covered the concepts of passing arrays between functions, both by value

 and by pointer. Remember to practice using multidimensional arrays and passing arrays between functions, and refer to the additional resources to reinforce your understanding of these topics.
