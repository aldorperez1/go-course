Lesson: Exploring Arrays in Go

Topic: Arrays

Introduction:
Arrays are essential data structures in Go that allow us to store and manipulate collections of elements. In this lesson, we will delve into the internals of arrays, understand how they are implemented, and explore various aspects of working with arrays in Go, including declaration, initialization, accessing elements, and assigning arrays.

1. Internals of Arrays:
- Arrays in Go are implemented as contiguous blocks of memory, with elements of the same type occupying adjacent memory locations.
- Each element in the array has a fixed size, determined by the type of the array.
- Memory for arrays is allocated statically at compile-time, based on the array's size.

2. Declaring and Initializing an Array:
- Declaring an array using an array literal:
  - Syntax: `var arrayName = [size]Type{elements}`
  - Example: `var numbers = [5]int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}` declares an array named "numbers" with a length of 5 and initializes it with the provided elements.

- Declaring an array with Go calculating size:
  - Syntax: `var arrayName = [...]Type{elements}`
  - Example: `var colors = [...]string{"red", "green", "blue"}` declares an array named "colors" with a length calculated based on the number of elements provided.

- Declaring an array initializing specific elements:
  - Syntax: `var arrayName [size]Type = [size]Type{elements}`
  - Example: `var weekdays [7]string = [7]string{"Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"}` declares an array named "weekdays" with a length of 7 and initializes specific elements.

3. Working with Arrays:
- Accessing an array's elements:
  - Elements in an array can be accessed using square bracket notation: `arrayName[index]`.
  - Example: `numbers[2]` accesses the element at index 2 in the "numbers" array.

- Accessing an array's pointer elements:
  - Go allows arrays of pointers to elements.
  - Example: `var ptrArray [3]*int` declares an array named "ptrArray" with a length of 3, where each element is a pointer to an int.

- Assigning one array to another of the same type (copy):
  - Arrays can be assigned to another array of the same type, and the values are copied.
  - Example: `var newArray = numbers` assigns the "numbers" array to a new array named "newArray."

- Compiler error assigning arrays of different types:
  - Go does not allow direct assignment of arrays of different types, even if the element types are compatible.
  - Example: `var otherArray [5]float64 = numbers` would result in a compiler error.

- Assigning one array of pointers to another:
  - Arrays of pointers can be assigned to another array of pointers of the same type, and the pointers are copied.
  - Example: `var newPtrArray = ptrArray` assigns the "ptrArray" array to a new array named "newPtrArray."
