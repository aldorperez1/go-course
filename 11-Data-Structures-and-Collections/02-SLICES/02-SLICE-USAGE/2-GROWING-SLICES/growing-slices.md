# Growing Slices in Go

Lesson Objectives:
1. Understand how to add elements to a slice using the `append` function.
2. Learn how to increase the length and capacity of a slice dynamically.
3. Explore best practices for efficiently growing slices in Go.
4. Provide additional resources for further exploration of slice operations.

Duration: Approximately 60 minutes

Lesson Outline:

I. Introduction to Slices (10 minutes)
   A. Recap on slices in Go and their dynamic nature.
   B. Briefly explain the concept of a slice's length and capacity.
   C. Emphasize the importance of growing slices efficiently.

II. Using append to Add Elements (20 minutes)
   A. Demonstrate the syntax of the `append` function.
   B. Explain how to add an element to a slice using `append`.
   C. Showcase code examples to illustrate the process.
   D. Discuss the behavior of `append` with respect to length and capacity.

III. Increasing Length and Capacity (25 minutes)
   A. Explain how `append` can increase both length and capacity.
   B. Discuss the implications of capacity for performance.
   C. Demonstrate how to utilize `append` to increase the length and capacity of a slice.
   D. Highlight the differences between `append` and direct assignment.

IV. Best Practices for Growing Slices (5 minutes)
   A. Emphasize the importance of preallocating slices when possible.
   B. Discuss the trade-off between capacity and memory usage.
   C. Recommend using the built-in `make` function for large slices.
   D. Encourage participants to write code that avoids unnecessary reallocations.

V. Additional Resources (5 minutes)
   A. Provide recommended resources for further learning:
      1. Official Go documentation: https://golang.org/doc/
      2. Go by Example: https://gobyexample.com/
      3. Effective Go: https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html
