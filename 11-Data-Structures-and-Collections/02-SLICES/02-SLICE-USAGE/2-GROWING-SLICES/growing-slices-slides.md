## Title Slide
Introduction to Growing Slices in Go

---
## Objective Slide
Objective:
- Understand how to add elements to a slice using `append`
- Learn how to increase the length and capacity of a slice dynamically
- Explore best practices for efficiently growing slices in Go

---
## Recap on Slices
- Slices are dynamically-sized and flexible data structures in Go
- They are references to underlying arrays and have a length and capacity
- Slices can grow dynamically as needed

---
## Using `append` to Add Elements
- `append` function: Adds elements to a slice
- Syntax: `slice = append(slice, element)`
- Demonstration with code examples
- Illustrate the process of adding an element to a slice using `append`

---
## Using `append` to Increase Length and Capacity
- `append` function can increase both length and capacity
- Length: Number of elements in the slice
- Capacity: Total number of elements the underlying array can hold
- Showcase code examples to demonstrate increasing length and capacity using `append`

---
## Best Practices for Growing Slices
- Preallocate slices when possible to avoid unnecessary reallocations
- Consider the trade-off between capacity and memory usage
- Use the built-in `make` function for large slices
- Emphasize writing code that minimizes reallocations for improved performance
