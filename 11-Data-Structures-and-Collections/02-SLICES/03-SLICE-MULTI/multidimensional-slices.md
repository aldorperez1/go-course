# Lesson: Multidimensional Slices in Go

Introduction:
In this lesson, we will explore multidimensional slices in the Go programming language. We will learn how to declare and work with multidimensional slices, as well as compose slices of slices to create more complex data structures. By the end of this lesson, you will understand the fundamentals of working with multidimensional slices and be able to apply them in your own Go programs.

1. Declaring a Multidimensional Slice:
   - A multidimensional slice in Go is essentially a slice of slices. Each element in the outer slice is itself a slice.
   - To declare a multidimensional slice, we start by declaring an outer slice and then initializing each inner slice separately.
   - Here's an example that declares a 2D slice representing a matrix:

   ```go
   var matrix [][]int
   ```

   - The above declaration creates an empty 2D slice. To initialize it with some values, we can use the `make` function:

   ```go
   matrix = make([][]int, numRows)
   for i := range matrix {
       matrix[i] = make([]int, numCols)
   }
   ```

   - In the example above, `numRows` and `numCols` represent the desired dimensions of the matrix. We initialize each inner slice with the required number of elements.

2. Accessing and Modifying Elements in a Multidimensional Slice:
   - Accessing elements in a multidimensional slice follows the same indexing syntax as with regular slices.
   - To access an element at row `i` and column `j` of the matrix, we use the syntax `matrix[i][j]`.
   - Similarly, to modify an element, we assign a new value to the desired index: `matrix[i][j] = newValue`.

3. Composing Slices of Slices:
   - In Go, it is possible to compose slices of slices to create more complex data structures.
   - Composing slices allows you to represent a 2D or higher-dimensional structure in a flexible manner.
   - Here's an example of composing a slice of slices to represent a 2D grid:

   ```go
   grid := [][]string{
       {"X", "O", "X"},
       {"O", "X", "O"},
       {"X", "O", "X"},
   }
   ```

   - In the example above, we declare and initialize a 2D slice using a composite literal. Each inner slice represents a row in the grid.

Additional Best Practices:
- Use the `len` function to obtain the length of the outer slice and `len(slice[i])` to obtain the length of the inner slice.
- Be mindful of the size and complexity of your multidimensional slices, as they can consume a significant amount of memory if used excessively.
- Consider using named types or struct types when working with multidimensional slices to improve code readability and maintainability.

Assignment:
Practice creating and manipulating multidimensional slices in Go. Write a program that performs the following tasks:
- Declare a 3x3 matrix using a multidimensional slice and initialize it with random integer values.
- Calculate the sum of all the elements in the matrix.
- Find the maximum value in each row of the matrix and print them.
- Print the matrix in a tabular format.
